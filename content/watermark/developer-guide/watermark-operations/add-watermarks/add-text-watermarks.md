# Introduction #

This REST API allows adding text watermarks to the document.

With this API you can add watermarks with following features:

* For a text watermark, you can use various text options like Font, Size, Style, Foreground and Background colors, etc.;
* There are many watermark positioning and transforming properties;
* There are format-specific options. These options allow to leverage specific format features and often allow to make watermarks stronger;
* For protected documents, it is required to provide the password.

The following example demonstrates how to add watermark to the document. Here you can see how to create a watermark with specific text, font, and color, position, and size.

## SDKs ##

Our API is completely independent of your operating system, database system or development language. You can use any language and platform that supports HTTP to interact with our API. However, manually writing client code can be difficult, error-prone and time-consuming. Therefore, we have provided and support API [SDKs](https://github.com/groupdocs-watermark-cloud) in many development languages in order to make it easier to integrate with us. If you use [SDK](https://github.com/groupdocs-watermark-cloud), it adds the [Watermark API](https://apireference.groupdocs.cloud/watermark/#/Watermark/Add) calls and lets you use GroupDocs Cloud features in a native way for your preferred language.
